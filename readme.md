# [Project Name] üéØ"SAVALA GIRI GIRI"


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Void


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Ajo Thomas - MITS
- Member 2: Betsy Biji - MITS


### Project Description
Savala Giri Giri is a completely useless yet hilariously entertaining project that counts the number of onion rings on your plate and generates the iconic Kalyanaraman dialog ‚ÄúSavala Giri Giri‚Ä¶‚Äù with the word ‚Äúgiri‚Äù repeated exactly as many times as the rings. To top it off, it pops up a perfectly timed meme image for maximum laughter.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
There is currently no easy way to turn a simple photo of onion rings into the iconic ‚ÄúSavala Giri Giri‚Ä¶‚Äù dialogue with the perfect number of ‚Äúgiri‚Äù repetitions. Without this, people are missing out on a fun, meme-worthy way to combine food pictures with classic movie humor.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Savala Giri Giri turns any onion ring photo into instant comedy gold ‚Äî you give the pic, we give you the legendary ‚ÄúSavala Giri Giri‚Ä¶‚Äù with the perfect number of ‚Äúgiri‚Äùs and a meme that hits just right. Simple, silly, and guaranteed to make you laugh.
